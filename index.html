    <h1>Jack Brodie UAL Projects</h1>
    <p>I am a second-year Graphic Design student from London studying at UAL Camberwell College of Arts. I specialise in
        web design and development, while also working in graphic design, programming, video, and music production. I am
        proficient in the Adobe creative suite, as well as Javascript. During my second year I have enjoyed making
        interactive works, combining my skills from different mediums, and exploring creative computing. I have had the
        opportunity
        to work on several creative projects alongside my studies, including a published book cover and getting to work
        with charity organisations such as ACORN UK and Little Heroes.</p>
